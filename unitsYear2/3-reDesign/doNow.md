#[Do Now] Project 2  - Rock, Paper, Scissors

The do now activity for this session is to visit the homepage for [Weather.com](www.weatehr.com). Once you are on that page answer the following questions on a piece of paper:

* Do you like the layout of this homepage? (Yes/No)
* What do you like or not like about it? (list three things)
* How can this homepage be improved?

After you have answered the questions above make a sketch of how you think this homepage should look. The sketch doe snot have to be detailed but it should layout the different components the site offers.
