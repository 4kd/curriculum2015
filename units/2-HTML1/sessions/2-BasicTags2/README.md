## Before Class
###Teacher Preparation
* Make sure the school’s computers have a basic text editor. **We will be using a text editor only for today’s lesson.** 
* If using a Mac, make sure TextEdit preferences are set to plain text, **NOT rich text.** 


### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to explain the structure of an HTML webpage.
* Students will be able to create a webpage that contains a head and a body.

### Key Points

* A webpage is a text document running in a browser.
* Programs/robots do not assume anything.
* HTML (Hyper Text Mark-Up Language) gives your webpage structure. 
* FILO! (First In Last Out) FILO is the structure for tags on any HTML page.

### Assessment

1. Informal assessment of student involvement during activity.
2. Final webpage sent to volunteers for review.


### Vocabulary

* Webpage
* HTML
* Tags
* File Extension

## During Class


### Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Starter question to students on the board: What is FILO and why is it important? 



### Opening

“Does anyone want to answer the starter question?” 

Students should answer the question and recall from the previous lesson that FILO stands for First In Last Out and refers to tag structure on any HTML page. 

### Introduction to New Material (“I Do”)

Before starting this section, ask students to close their laptops. Provide a very brief lecture on the head tag. There are 2 slides in the Google Presentation to use (see references).


### Independent Practice ("You Do")

Ask students to return to the document they previously made in the last class (they should have it in their email from having submitted it) and change the webpage firstpage.html to include a title (seen below).

**Extension:** ask students to experiment with h1- h6 and several paragraphs.

### Introduction to New Material #2 (“I Do”)

Explain to the students how to access the console on their browsers. Bring up a website (preferably an article based site that is gender neutral - i.e. about.com, bbc.co.uk, etc.). Showcase how using the console you can edit and personalize features on a site that is only viewable on your local machine. If using chrome be sure to point out the magnifying tool to easily locate the text on a page. 


### Independent Practice #2 ("You Do")

Ask students to visit nytimes.com and choose an article. Using the console, ask them to edit the page to be a story about themselves.

**Extension:** ask students to experiment with other sites they frequent.


### Closing/Homework
Wrap up the day with a quick recap on everything that was covered. Ask students to share their article by taking a screenshot and showcasing to the front. 


## After Class
* Take a quick look at each project from today. Students who were not able to create the page should be asked to recreate it, with teacher’s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
