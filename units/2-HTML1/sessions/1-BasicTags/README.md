## Before Class
###Teacher Preparation
* Make sure the school’s computers have a basic text editor. **We will be using a text editor only for today’s lesson.** 
* If using a Mac, make sure TextEdit preferences are set to plain text **NOT rich text.** 


### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to explain the structure of an HTML webpage.
* Students will be able to create a webpage that contains a head and a body.

### Key Points

* A webpage is a text document running in a browser.
* Programs/robots do not assume anything.
* HTML (Hyper Text Mark-Up Language) gives your webpage structure. 
* FILO! (First In Last Out) FILO is the structure for tags on any HTML page.

### Assessment

1. Informal assessment of student involvement during activity.
2. Final webpage sent to volunteers for review.


### Vocabulary

* Webpage
* HTML
* Tags
* File Extension

## During Class

### Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Starter question to students on the board: How is a website created?



### Opening

“Does anyone want to answer the starter question?” 

Students should answer the question and eventually arrive at the fact that HTML is a language used to create webpages. 

### Introduction to New Material (“I Do”)

“So we all know HTML is used to write a webpage, but has anyone ever seen HTML code?” 

The teacher should now open a website students are familiar with on the screen and view the page source. Once here, change some of the text on the webpage. Ask students “How did I know where to look in the HTML?”


### Guided Practice (“We Do”)

“Okay everyone, open your computers and follow along with me.” 

Once again on the board open another website. This time a very plain page with little to no CSS like the first site made at Cern (see references). All together, find a specific piece of text and manipulate it. 

### Independent Practice ("You Do")

“Now I want everyone to take the next 5 minutes to change as many things on this webpage as possible.”
Teacher should now circulate and assist any student who does not understand how to manipulate HTML text. After the 5 minutes are complete, encourage students to share what they changed on the site.

### Closing/Homework
Wrap up the day with a quick recap on everything that was covered. Ask the students to share their webpages with you for review. Explain they can email the text file to you. 

## After Class
* Take a quick look at each webpage project from today. Students who were not able to create the page should be asked to recreate it, with teacher’s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
