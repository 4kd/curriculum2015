## During class

### Do-now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Starter question to students on the board: How is a website created?



## Opening

“Does anyone want to answer the starter question?” Students should answer the question and eventually arrive at the fact that HTML is a language used to create webpages. 

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)

“So we all know HTML is used to write a webpage, but has anyone ever seen HTML code?” The teacher should now open a website students are familiar with on the screen and view the page source. Once here change some of the text on the webpage. Ask students “How did I know where to look in the HTML.”


## Guided Practice (“We Do”)

“Okay everyone open your computers and follow along with me.” Once again on the board open another website. This time a very plain page with little to no CSS (recommendation: use the first site made at Cern.. see references.) All together, find a specific piece of text and manipulate it. 

## Independent practice ("You do")

“Now I want everyone to take the next 3 minutes to change as many things on this webpage as possible.”
Teacher should now circulate and assist any student who does not understand how to manipulate HTML text. After the 3 minutes are complete encourage students to share what they changed on the site.

## Introduction of new material #2 (“I Do”)

Before starting this section ask students to close their laptops and take notes. The teacher will give a 3-4 minute lecture on tags, tag stucture and FILO (First In Last Out). The teacher may use the Google Presentation provide in the references.


## Guided Practice #2(“We Do”)

“Okay everyone open your computers and follow along with me.” Once again on the board open another website. This time a very plain page with little to no CSS (recommendation: use the first site made at Cern.. see references.) All together, find a specific piece of text and manipulate it. 

## Independent practice #2("You do")

Ask students to create the webpage firstpage.html (Seen below) using a text editor. **Student may need to be shown how to open this file in the browser.**

**Extension:** ask students to experiment with h1- h6 and several paragraphs.


## Closing/ Homework
Wrap up the day with a quick recap on everything that was covered. Ask the students to share their webpages with you for review. Explain they can email the text file to you. 


## After Class
* Take a quick look at each webpage project from today. Students who were not able to create the page should be asked to recreate it, with teacher’s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
