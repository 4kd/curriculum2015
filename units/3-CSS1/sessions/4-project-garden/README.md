##Before Class

###Teacher Preparation 
* Familiarize yourself with [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)
* Decide on how to best distribute [starter code](starter-code) to students.


### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

###Vocabulary
* Starter Code

### Assessment

1. Students will have put CSS styling skills to use by editing an HTML file.

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).


###Opening

Introduce the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Explain that as developers you always want to test your skills and create new things. Be sure to showcase some of the various submissions and highlight how this is all based on the same starter code. Today's project will be our version of the CSS Zen Garden


###I Do
Walk students through the process of accessing the starter code and pasting it into the appropriate fields on [JSBin](http://jsbin.com). Review some of the styling tags they have learned in the previous lessons. Emphasize that they must keep the text and images since this is based on design and ***not*** content.

###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Extension Activities
Students who complete the project at hand early may attempt to improve their project by including the following:  

* Manipulating the layout

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
The students must export this project as a Gist.
File > Export as Gist
