### Vocabulary

* CSS Cascading Style Sheets
* Syntax


###References

## During class

### Do-now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Students are completing the Do Now task:  
Instruct students to retrieve their code from last session (images project) and have it ready to be edited.  

This can be done by: 
1. Logging into GitHub 
2. Finding your Gists
3. Clicking on the JS Bin link in your Gist.


## Opening

What makes a page easy to use and look nice? THE WAY IT IS STYLED! 

CSS is added to an HTML page to give a page style. Style can be anything from placement of an item to the way it looks to color, etc.

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)

Instructor should open a JS Bin file with some content (text, images)

To add styles to my page I am going to open up the CSS pane by clicking the CSS button in JS Bin.

The first style I am going to add is going to be to make the background color of my webpage blue.

```
body{
  background:blue;
}
```

The instructor should not get hung up on the syntax of the style right now. Instead they should tell the students that if they do not know the syntax for adding a style the should Google "adding CSS style to a page"



## Guided Practice (“We Do”)

Instruct students to open two windows on their computer:

1. Their images project (should already be open from the do now)
2. This page www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.asp 

Ask students to align all the text on their page to the center using CSS.


## Independent practice ("You do")

After students have applied 1 style to their page they are ready to style the page on their own. Tell the students to add the following criteria:

* At least one style that applies only the paragraph text
* At least two styles that apply to the entire body
* At least two more styles you can find on W3schools or through a Google search.

During the time while students are adding styles the teacher will circulate to help with technical issues and encourage students to push their abilities.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).

###How to Submit (can take 5+ minutes)
After the students have created this page they must save this page properly by completing the directions found in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uBzV_Ai6KtdSYoNc4izqnihwMvqzSp8sXmX6uF5PNGY/edit?usp=sharing)

Students must then share their **Gist URL** at bit.ly/ScriptEdProjects

## After Class
* Take a quick look at each webpage project from today. Students who were not able to create the page should be asked to recreate it, with teacher’s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
