#Unit 13 - Loops & Arrays

##Synopsis
This unit introduces arrays and loops to our students. Students will learn how to initialize, store, and read from arrays. They will also learn how to access and manipulate individual elements of the array. Students will also learn the basics of loops. They will start with ``while`` loops and learn what an index is and the broader concept of iteration. They will then be introduced to the upgraded ``for`` loop. Finally, they will connect their knowledge of arrays to loops.

##Standards

###CPP.L2-05 I - Arrays
1. Student can use	arrays:	student	demonstrates	understanding	that	the	first	index	is	0;	student	can	access	elements	of	the array	and	change them;	student	can	find	the	length	of	an array.
2. Student can	perform	the	`pop`,	`push`,	`shift`,	`unshift`,	`slice`,	`concat`,	and	`join`	operations	on	arrays.

###CPP.L2-05 I - Loops
1. Student can	use	``while``	and	``for``	loops	and	avoid	infinite	loops.
2. Student understands	and	can	use	``break``,	``continue``,	and	``return``	statements.
