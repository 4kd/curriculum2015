2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. [Do Now](doNow.md) activity

###Opening

Sometimes a simple webpage can be difficult to create.

Let's take a look at a simple page we will be creating today. Lead teacher show demonstration of solution code.

###Lecture

You are going to build a simple Facebook Wall. Your instructions:

##Instructions

There is no Starter Code for this project. Before beginning to write code you must first wireframe the page you will make. 

###1) Wireframe
1. You may choose to wireframe this site with pen and paper or with a free online wireframing tool.
2. Your wireframe must be approved by an instructor before moving onto step 2.

###2) Create a GitHub Repo
Before you begin writing the code for this project one member of the group must first create a new repository in GitHub.   
For information on how to create a new GitHub Repository see [this resource](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

###3) Clone your new repo into a Cloud9 account workspace
1. Copy the "clone URL" from your new repository
2. In your Cloud9 dashboard click on the "Create a New Workspace" button and select "Clone from URL"
3. Give this workspace an name that is appropriate and be sure it is set to public.
4. Insert the clone URL from this repo and select a custom template

Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push you changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub. Your manager will be grading you on this.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

###4) Share your Cloud9 workspace with your partner
You and your partner can work on the code for this project at the same time using the collaboration feature in CLoud9.

In order to set this up click on the "Share" Button in the top-right hand corner of your workspace

###Bonus) 
Your Manager has offered a stipend a $500 for each of the bonus requirements listed below: 

* Add CSS to this project using Bootstrap. Give it it's own theme
* Create a game with more variety in throwing opitons. Example: [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)

##Grading Criteria
Your manager will be grading your capibility on this project based on [this rubric](assessment.md)

##How to Submit

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

##Homework
