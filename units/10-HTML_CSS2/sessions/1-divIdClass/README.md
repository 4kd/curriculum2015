## Before class

### Objective

Students will be able to use the div tag in conjunction with IDs and Classes to idnetify areas of a webpage

### Key points

* The div tag is a container. It can hold text, images and/or both.
* By using an ID or a class you can identify portions of an HTML page more closely



### Assessment

1. Do-now activity. Located in slide 2 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-u9ykoA-npHz9hdGeWEqAJrBmCTT5xP6xvYWs69IqYY/edit?usp=sharing) 
2. Write exit-ticket based off [assessments from current lesson](assessments/exit_ticket.md).

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the do now and exit-ticket quiz.


### Vocabulary

* Div
* ID
* Class

## During class

### Do-now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Place the do now on the board. The starter question can be found in slide 2 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-u9ykoA-npHz9hdGeWEqAJrBmCTT5xP6xvYWs69IqYY/edit?usp=sharing)


## Opening

Discuss the answers of the Do now with the class (slide 3 of the [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-u9ykoA-npHz9hdGeWEqAJrBmCTT5xP6xvYWs69IqYY/edit?usp=sharing)). 

Explain to the students that today they will be learning how to identify parts of a webpage. 

"If you look at the source of any webpage you will notice it is made up mostly of div tags that are identified with IDs and classes"

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)
#####What is an ID? (slide 4-5)
Giving a tag an ID is like giving it a name. If you didn't have a name it would be very hard to call on you in this classroom.

When using IDs you must ensure that you use the proper syntax noted in slides 4 and 5. 

Can anyone think of a time they were making a webpage and could have used an ID to improve their page? 

#####What is a Class? (slide 6-8)
Classes are very similar to IDs. They are also used to identify a tag.

They are called on in CSS using a `.` and not a `#`

In many cases they can be used interchangable. However you should always use a class to group several IDs. (slide 8)

#####What is a Div? (slide 9)
The Div tag is used more than any other tag. Now that you are creating larger and more complicated sites you should get use to using Div tags for almost everything.


## Guided Practice (“We Do”)
Follow the directions on slide 10 to set up an environment for the You Do portion of this class.

## Independent practice ("You do")

In the workspace the students just created they must now make a simple HTML page that uses Divs, IDs and Classes.

Encourage students to take this task even farther by adding images and more styles.

#### Exit ticket

Give exit-ticket quiz.

# Closing

## Check for understanding
Leave time at the end of class for students to wrap up and ask teachers any questions they may have.  


##How to Submit
Students must push their code to their GitHub repo using the following commands in the Cloud 9 Terminal:

`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

This project does not yet have to be share with the instructors.

##Homework
Students who are not complete with their site by the end of class should complete it at home for homework. 

## After Class

*  Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
