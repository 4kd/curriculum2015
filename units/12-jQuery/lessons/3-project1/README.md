# The jQuery Site

The jQuery site will be created in the process of completing the You Do sections of [lesson 1](1-selectors/README.md) & [lesson 2](2-events/README.md) of this unit.


##Scope

The focus of this project is to create a website using almost entirely jQuery code. There will be some basic HTML code for jQuery interaction but that is all.
