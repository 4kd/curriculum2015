##Scope

This project inolves the students creating a 4-page website about themselves. Emphasis will be placed on styling these sites using a common stylesheet.
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

### Starter code

There is no starter code for this project. To view how this project will be set up look at the I Do, We do and You Do portion of [lesson 1](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015/tree/master/units/9-HTML2/lessons/1-linkingPages) and [lesson 2](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015/tree/master/units/9-HTML2/lessons/2-styleScript)

### Solution code

There is no solution code for this project. The Student can be as creative as they would like.

However, feel free to show off examples of personal sites like [this](http://annaellenberger.com/)and [this](http://thomasjfrank.com/v2/) for inspiration. (These links are also found in the Do Now)

### Assessment

1. Complete [Do Now](do_now.md) activity

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Complete [Do Now](do_now.md) activity

###Opening

What is a personal site? What are some advantages to having your own personal site?

###Lecture

Today you are going to bild a 4 page site about yourself. You are welcome to use the site you created in the last two lessons to get yourself started (Cloud 9 workspace called "link-practice").

Your website must have:

* A homepage (can also be your about me)
* Three other relevant pages. Suggestions include: photos, contact me, projects/portfolio, etc. 


###Wireframing
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. On paper, draw a design for what you would like your home page to look like. Students must have their wireframe approved by a teacher before moving on.
2. Decide what color scheme you would like for your site.


###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

##How to Submit
Students must push all final code to their GitHub repository. Students will then share the link to their repo at bit.ly/ScriptEdProjects

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`
