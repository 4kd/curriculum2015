##Scope

This project involves implementing the core functionality for a simple mad libs game. The objective of this project is for students to practice their string manipulation skills. 
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the strings lesson.

### Starter code

See [here](http://jsbin.com/luheqo/edit?html,js,output) for code. 

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/6-javascript1_2/lessons/2-project) for code (private).

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. [Do-now](assessment/do_now) activity

###Opening

What is madlibs? Let's play a game together [here](http://www.madglibs.com/showglib.php?glibid=180).

###Lecture
You are going to build a madlibs game that any user can play. Starter code is provided to you. Much of the code will not make sense right now and that is okay. The important thing for right now is to add a minimum of 10 parts of speech for the user to input.

At this point the teacher should demonstrate a working model of the [solution code](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/6-javascript1_2/lessons/2-project) (private repo) to the class. **Be sure to hide the URL of the solution code when displaying to class.**
 
#### 1. Clone the Starter Code

Open the Starter code link at http://jsbin.com/qorisi/edit?html,js,output  

Once you are looking at the code go to File > Clone to create a new workspace for yourself.

#### 2. Create a story with ten parts of speech

In order to add more parts of speech you will need to to three things:

1. In the HTML copy the line of code that begins with `input type`. You will also need to make a custom ID for each item.
2. In the JavaScript, increase the length of `var story`
3. In the JavaScript, copy more `var inputValue` lines.

Two of the parts of speech are already there for you. You will need to add 8 more. Get creative!


###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Extension Activities
Students who complete the project at hand early may attempt to improve their project by including the following:  

* Added CSS for visual customization
* A second MadLibs story
* Create a site in which the user is first prompted to choose between 2 or more MadLibs stories to fill in.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
The students must export this project as a Gist.   
File > Export as Gist  

The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project at bit.ly/ScriptEdProjects
